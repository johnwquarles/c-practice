Make an automated suite that tests against expected outcomes for standard use cases,
as well as every special case I could think of.

Specifically: is '\n' the only way to make a new line? If not, then use an alternative
could lead to an inaccurate new line count. Does '\r' (carriage return) work?

Could test all of the problematic strings listed here:

Hmm, might also want to run a regular expression against the content of a word to
ensure alphabetic content, since lone punctuation marks & numbers (or groups of either)
will currently be counted as words.

As for input likely to uncover bugs: try any/everything
(accented letters, non-Roman alphabet, etc.), and exotic combinations thereof.
